# Project Overview
This sales dashboard is designed to provide insights into sales performance across different countries, regions, and product categories.
The dashboard is built using Power BI and utilizes data from three separate files: customers data (CSV), products data (TXT), and sales data (Excel).

# Data Source
The sample dataset was gotten from AQSKILL and the data used in this dashboard is sourced from three files:
- Customers Data (CSV): Contains customer information, including city, state, country and region etc.
- Products Data (TXT): Contains product information, including product categories.
- Sales Data (Excel): Contains sales transaction data, including country, region, product, and sales amount.

# Data Transformation
Before loading the data into Power BI, all three files were transformed using Power Query Editor to:
- Clean and format the data
- Remove any unnecessary columns or rows
- Perform quality checks
- Transform the data into a suitable format for analysis

# Data Modeling
After transforming the data, the following data modeling steps were performed:
- Created relationships between the three tables (customers, products, and sales)
- Defined data types and formats for each column

# DAX Measures
The following DAX measures were created to analyze sales performance:
- Total Sales by Country: Calculates the total sales amount for each country.
- Overall Total Sales: Calculates the total sales amount across all countries.
- Sales by Region: Calculates the total sales amount for each region.
- Sales by Product Category: Calculates the total sales amount for each category.

# Visualizations
The following visualizations were created to showcase sales performance:
- Cards: Display the total sales amount for each country, including Nigeria, Ghana, US and UK.
